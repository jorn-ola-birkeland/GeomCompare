===========
GeomCompare
===========


    Compare two sets of geometrical/geographical features.


*GeomCompare* provides multiple tools for comparing two independant sets
of geometrical/geographical features. It can be used to identify
features with similar geometry/geography (based on pre-defined
similarity functions) found in both sets, as well features with
geometry/geography that are found in only one of the
sets. *GeomCompare* defines a few similarity functions, but it
possible for the user to define its own customized similarity
functions.
