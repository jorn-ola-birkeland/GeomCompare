- Add documentation/tests
- Documentation on Readthedocs
- Upgrade API of PostGISGeomRefDB and RtreeGeomRefDB classes so that
  they match that of the SQLiteGeomRefDB class.
- Add a 'query' argument to the function 'fetch_geoms_from_pg' so that
  the user can write its own SQL queries that return geometries, which
  will be directly converted to shapely geometric objects.
- Add 'aoi' and 'aoi_epsg' arguments to the 'extract_geoms_from_file'
  function.
- Possibility to run geomcompare scripts?
